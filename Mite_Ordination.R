# Adding the environmental variables in the plot --------------------------

#Pane 1 shows that the Ceratoz3 species is found on the right side of the ordination diagram,
#where it mostly abundant.

#Pane 2 shows the SSTR species is highly abundant on the left side of the ordination diagram,
#with green lines indicating that the circles that lie on the same line have thae same abundance
# of this particular species.

#Pane 3 shows that the Trhypch1 species is abundant on the right side of the ordination diagram
#with the big circles showing where this species is highly abundant.

#Pane 4 illustates the abundance of the Trimalc2 species abundance together with the environmental
#variables and pane 3 and pane 4 shows some covariance, where these species are highly abundant.
#The environmental variables that show much influence on the abundance of these mites is 
# Water Content and Substrate Density, this is ecological reasonable as there are mites that
#live in water, meaning these mites in this dataset are those that prefer water as the habitat.


# The Shepered plot shows that there is a good relationship between Ordination Distance and 
#Observed Dissimilarity, with a good r squared that is 0.978.


# Do PCoA for mite abundance data -----------------------------------------

plot(Spe_pcoa, scaling = 1, main = "PCoA mite abundances - biplot scaling 1")
plot(Spe_pcoa, scaling = 2, main = "PCoA mite abundances - biplot scaling 2")

#Scaling 1 biplot shows that the sites are concentrated on the centre of the ordination,
# and towards the right side of the ordination, and most of these species will most occur on
#those concentrated sites.


#Scaling 2 biplot shows that these species are closely associated and will be highly
# abundant on sites 46 and 69 of the ordination diagram.


# Section 2 ---------------------------------------------------------------

data("dune")
data("dune.env")

#This dataset was collected as a part of the project focused on the effect of management on dune meadows.
#It contains 20 plots of 2Ã—2 m2, sampled in 1982 following Braun-Blanquet method estimating plant cover 
#in each plot (using 9-grade ordinal cover scale). Total of 30 species (28 vascular and 2 bryophytes) 
#were recorded.

# Calculate the PCA -------------------------------------------------------

#Scaling plot 1 on the right side of the ordination shows that 14 and 15
#are closely related and are influenced by Moisture content of the soil and Thickness of the A1 horizon.


#Scaling plot 2 on the right side of the ordination shows that thickness of the A1 horizon
# and moisture content of the soil are strongly correlated based on the side of the angle
# betwwen these varialbe vectors.



# Do Correspondence Analysis ----------------------------------------------

# Ordination diagrams -----------------------------------------------------

plot(spe_ca, scaling = 1, main = "CA dune abundances - biplot scaling 1")
plot(spe_ca, scaling = 2, main = "CA dune abundances - biplot scaling 2")

#Scaling 1 biplot shows that sites 17 and 19 are closely assocciated and the 
#species Anthodor is likely to occur in both these two sites. Also sites 15,16 and 20
# on the right side of the ordination are closely associated at the species that occur
#in these sites are the same.


#Scaling 2 biplot on the right site of the ordination shows that
#species Callcusp, Ranuflam, Eleopalu and Comapalu are closely associated in terms of distance,
#which means that all these species are high likely to occur in the same site, 
#which in this case is site 15.

#Pane 2 shows that the Eleopalu species also occurs on the right side of the ordination
#diagram, with big circles that fall on the same green line meaning these sites have
#same abundance of this species.

#Pane 3 shows that the Callcusp is also abundant on the right side of the ordination,
#diagram with the same big circles sowing the high abundance of this species.


#Pane 4 shows that the Ranuflam is abundant on the sites that are on the right side of the ordination
# diagram, then in all these four panes there is covarriance on where these species are abundant.

#Based on the sites where these species are mostly abundant Moisture is the
